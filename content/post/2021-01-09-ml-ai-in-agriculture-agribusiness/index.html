<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Agriculture sector in India contributes around 15% in GDP and employs around 50% of Indian population. The agriculture sector is plagued with many inefficiencies and bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Though India stands second worldwide in farm outputs (2018), the productivity in agriculture sector is among the lowest in the world. India being one the largest producers of most of the agricultural crops (both food grains and non- food grain) but ranks are very low in terms of productivity.</p>
<p>India is the second largest producer of rice and wheat in the world, but in terms of productivity the ranks are and 38 respectively. India is the largest producer of pulses, but it is only 138 in the world. Thus after the tremendous effect of Green Revolution, productivity (yield per hectare) has not improved much.</p>

<h2>Bottlenecks in Indian Agriculture</h2>
<p>As per Article shared by Tushar Seth on “Productivity Level of Indian Agriculture: Factors and Measures”, following factors influence agriculture productivity in India :</p>
<ul>
<li>Rural and Archaic Practices</li>
<li>High Land-Man Ratio</li>
<li>Land Degradation</li>
<li>Existence of Big Farmers</li>
<li>Irregular and Poor Credit &amp; Marketing Facilities</li>
<li>Lack of Irrigation Facilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stages in AGriculture</h2>
<p>To resolve problems of agriculture sector, we must know the critical stages in agriculture. Following stages of agriculture can be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation of Soil</li>
<li>Sowing of Seeds</li>
<li>Fertilizers and Other Inputs Management</li>
<li>Irrigation Planning</li>
<li>Weeds and Pest Protection Measures</li>
<li>Harvest Management</li>
<li>Storage Management</li>
<li>Marketing of Produce</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="machine-learning-artificial-intelligence-applications" class="section level2">
<h2>Machine Learning &amp; Artificial Intelligence Applications</h2>
<p>Keeping in mind these important stages of agriculture, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence applications (ML &amp; AI apps) can assist farmer in improving farm productivity.</p>
<div id="weather-forecasting" class="section level3">
<h3>Weather Forecasting</h3>
<p>Seed sowing, irrigation etc. need a optimized schedule to improve farm productivity. Seed sowing time is very dicey decision and most of the later stages depend heavily on this decision. ML &amp; AI apps can help in this decision with very high accuracy. Over the period of time the accuracy of the apps will improve due to real data inputs.</p>
</div>
<div id="ai-based-pest-detection" class="section level3">
<h3>AI Based Pest Detection</h3>
<p>AI &amp; ML apps can detect the pests much earlier than man can do. IoT (Internet of Things) kits need to be installed in the farms and hourly data capture by IoT kits can feed data into ML &amp; AI apps to identify the types of pests, density of intrusion, etc. can be calculated with much more precision. It can recommend the required amount of pesticide doses spread based on pests density in the farm so the spending on pesticide can be optimized.</p>
</div>
<div id="soil-crop-health-management-analytics" class="section level3">
<h3>Soil &amp; Crop Health Management &amp; Analytics</h3>
<p>ML &amp; AI applications can track real time soil and crop health through visuals of the farm and other data inputs. It can suggest right crop for the soil, estimated yield from the farm, input requirements like water, fertilizers, pesticides, weedicides etc.</p>
<p>Pre-calculation of such important elements of farm can save big proportion on input costs. Thus improves the farm’s net income.</p>
</div>
<div id="improving-harvest-quality" class="section level3">
<h3>Improving Harvest Quality</h3>
<p>AI and ML applications are core part of Precision Agriculture where in thousands of data points of the farm ground are gathered through IoT and Aerial Devices. Such huge data can be fed to ML and AI apps to give razor-sharp decision prescription. This can optimize the harvest quality much more significantly than that of a manual practice.</p>
<p>There can be many more applications, we just discussed some popular ones. There is lot of scope of research in developing AI and ML applications based on different agri-climatic regions, crop type, ecosystem and climate change.</p>

<div id="bottlenecks-in-implementing-ai-ml-in-agriculture" class="section level2">
<h2>Bottlenecks in Implementing AI &amp; ML in Agriculture</h2>
<p>AI &amp; ML applications need loads of data, huge data storage capacity, fast processing speed and smooth internet connectivity. Internet connectivity is most critical of these. In rural India, though internet network is catching up very fast, yet there is lot more needs to be done.</p>
<p>There is lack of AI &amp; ML facilities and far from the reach of farmers in hinterlands. There is need of more number of startups who can take these as business models and try to provide these services to the farmers.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Agriculture sector is the major employer in our country. Increasing farm level income means increasing income of 50% of population in India. AI and ML applications based startups should be encouraged and well funded to accelerate the progress in agriculture sector.</p>
